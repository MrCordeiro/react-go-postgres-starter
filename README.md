# Go/React/Postgres Starter Project

This project is a starter for creating a full-stack application with a React frontend, a Go server, a PostgreSQL database, basic authentication, and a development environment in a Docker container.

## Project Structure

- `.devcontainer/`: Contains the Docker configuration for the development environment.
- `server/`: Contains the Go server code.
- `web/`: Contains the React application code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Use the "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container" command (or click the >< in the bottom-left corner) to start the development environment.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement user authentication.
- [ ] Create the React application in the `web/` directory.
- [ ] Write the Go server in the `server/` directory.
- [ ] Transform the project into a [Cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/) template.
